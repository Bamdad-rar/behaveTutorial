Feature: multiply and divide

    our application has the feature to multiply and divide stuff!
    thats pretty dope.

    Scenario: when we try to multiply to numbers
        When I try to multiply 2 with 3
        Given that I dont want to see the decimal values
        Then I will get 6 as a result
